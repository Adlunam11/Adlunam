The most recent development in the decentralised finance (DeFi) industry is the Initial DEX Offerings (IDOs). By selling their tokens on decentralised exchanges (DEXs) rather than more conventional centralised exchanges, IDOs allow blockchain initiatives to launch their tokens and raise money. IDO platforms will be defined in this article along with their functions and advantages.
An IDO Platform is what?
A decentralised exchange (DEX) called an IDO platform enables blockchain projects to introduce their tokens and make money by offering them to investors. IDO platforms don’t need authorization to list tokens, unlike conventional centralised exchanges, and anybody may take part in the token sale. On a blockchain, where investors may trade tokens peer-to-peer (P2P), the token sale is taking place.
How Do IDO Platforms Operate?
The following steps are commonly included in the IDO process:
The blockchain project states that a special IDO platform will be used for the launch of its coin.
The project offers details about the token, including its quantity, price, and method of distribution.
By syncing their wallet with the IDO platform, investors who are interested in purchasing the token can take part in the token sale.
Investors are able to submit buy orders for the token, and the IDO platform will carry them out in accordance with the smart contract for the token.
When the token sale is over, the tokens are sent to buyers’ wallets and trading on the DEX starts.
